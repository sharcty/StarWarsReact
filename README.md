# StarWars

The goal of this project is to create a web application that allows users to explore the list of Star Wars characters along with detailed information about the starships and films associated with each character. This app utilize ReactJS for the UI and React Flow for displaying the data as a graph. Users are able to see how each character connects with different starships and films in an interactive visualization.
